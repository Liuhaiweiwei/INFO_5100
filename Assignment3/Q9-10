Encapsulation:
1.Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class
and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
2.As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
3.Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private
and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.

public class Encapsulate{
    private String geekName;
    private int geekRoll;
    private int geekAge;

    public int getAge(){
      return geekAge;
    }
    public String getName(){
      return geekName;
    }
    public int getRoll(){
       return geekRoll;
    }
    public void setAge(int newAge){
      this.geekAge = newAge;
    }
    public void setName(String newName){
      this.geekName = newName;
    }
    public void setRoll(int newRoll){
      this.geekRoll = newRoll;
    }
}

Advantages of Encapsulation:
1.Data Hiding
2.Increased Flexibility
3.Reusability
4.Testing code is easy

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user. Ðžnly the functionality will be provided to the user.
In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

In addition to the fact that abstract classes cannot instantiate objects, other functions of the class still exist,
and member variables, member methods, and constructors are accessed in the same way as normal classes.

Since abstract classes cannot instantiate objects, abstract classes must be inherited in order to be used.
Also for this reason, it is usually decided at the design stage whether or not to design an abstract class.

Parent classes contain common methods for collections of subclasses, but because the parent classes themselves are abstract, they cannot be used.
In Java, an abstract class represents an inheritance relationship.
A class can only inherit one abstract class, while a class can implement multiple interfaces.
