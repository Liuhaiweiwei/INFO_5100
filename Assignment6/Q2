Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.
--------------------------------------------------------
1. ArrayList implemented with the concept of dynamic array, LinkedList implemented with the concept of doubly linked list.
2.Insertion and Removal are easy and fast in LinkedList as compared to ArrayList.
Because there is no risk of resizing array and copying content to new array if array gets full which makes adding into
ArrayList of O(n) in worst case, while adding is O(1) operation in LinkedList in Java.
ArrayList also needs to be update its index if you insert something anywhere except.
