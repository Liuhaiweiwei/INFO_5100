Explain the difference between final and finally in Java 8.
-------------------------------------------------------------
final:
1.The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods,
which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).
2.The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value.
finally:
The finally keyword is used to execute code (used with exceptions - try..catch statements)
no matter if there is an exception or not.
